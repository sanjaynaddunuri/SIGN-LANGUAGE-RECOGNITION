# SIGN-LANGUAGE-RECOGNITION
This project presents a Sign Language Recognition System developed using Python, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It enables real-time detection of hand gestures from sign language and translates them into corresponding textual outputs, bridging the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the rest of society.
